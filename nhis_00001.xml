      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the selection of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

Users should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year. See the User Notes on the use of sampling weights for additional information.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[LONGWEIGHT is the final Longitudinal Weight offered in the original NHIS public use files. LONGWEIGHT was created to allow analysis of individual-level changes from 2019 to 2020 in the longitudinal sample.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, about half of the original NHIS sample allocated for the last five months of 2020 was replaced with persons that completed a Sample Adult interview in the 2019 NHIS. This group of sample adults that completed interviews in the 2019 and 2020 NHIS are referred to as the "longitudinal" sample. Persons in the longitudinal sample were interviewed for the 2020 NHIS at least 12 months after their initial 2019 interview date. According to the 2020 Survey Description, the longitudinal sample was introduced "due to concerns about possible loss of coverage and lower response rates typically associated with telephone interviewing." See the user note on COVID-related changes to the NHIS for more information. Due to methodological concerns, sample children were not included in the longitudinal sample.

Researchers may use NHISPID in 2019 and NHISPIDPRVYR in 2020 to link the longitudinal sample across these two years of data. Please see NHISPIDPRVYR for more information.

PARTWEIGHT was created to allow estimates that are based only on the respondents from the original 2020 NHIS sample (i.e., excluding the longitudinal sample). According to the 2020 Survey Description, PARTWEIGHT is only recommended for use with 2020 data when pooling 2019 and 2020 data to increase sample size. In that case, SAMPWEIGHT should be used as the weight for the 2019 data. A user might, for example, create a new weight and assign PARTWEIGHT values for 2020 and SAMPWEIGHT values for 2019.

      <txt><![CDATA[ASTATFLG identifies the record of a sample adult. A sample adult is the one person over age 18 per household who is randomly selected to complete the sample adult questionnaire. For 1997-2018, a sample adult is the one adult per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument to answer additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997.  All persons other than sample adults (those not having the value 1 in ASTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from the additional questions asked only of sample adults.  (Some additional questions were asked of both sample adults and sample children.)  Every adult in each family, except for active duty armed forces members, was eligible to be selected as the sample adult.  

Prior to 2019, ASTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample adult" (code 4) for all adults in the family in the following two cases: 1) sample adult status was incorrectly assigned to someone in the armed forces, or 2) it could not be ascertained which adult in the family was chosen as sample adult.   

For 2020 only, SALNGPRTFLG further distinguishes between sample adults included in the longitudinal sample and sample adults included in the partial sample. Please see the user note on COVID-related changes to the NHIS for more information on the longitudinal and partial samples.

A similar flag variable, CSTATFLG, identifies the record of a sample child.

This variable is automatically included in all extracts, but only has valid values for 1997 forward.]]></txt>

      <labl>Sample child flag</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[CSTATFLG identifies the record of a sample child. A sample child is the one person under age 18 per household who is randomly selected to complete the sample child questionnaire. For 1997-2018, the sample child is the one person under age 18 per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument for additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997. All persons other than sample children (those not having the value 1 in CSTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from these additional questions asked only of sample children.  (Some additional questions were asked of both sample adults and sample children.)   

Prior to 2019, Every child in each family, except for active duty armed forces members and emancipated minors, was eligible to be selected as the sample child.  Emancipated minors are persons age 14 to 17 who are married or living with a partner OR who live on their own without the supervision of a parent, other adult family member, or legal guardian.  

CSTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample child" (code 4) for all children in the family in the following two cases prior to 2019: 1) if sample child status was incorrectly assigned to someone who was ineligible, or 2) if it was unknown which child in the family was chosen as sample child.   

A similar flag variable, ASTATFLG, identifies the record of a sample adult.

This variable is automatically included in all extracts, but only has valid values for 1997 forward.]]></txt>

      <labl>Sexual orientation</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults ages 18 and older, SEXORIEN reports the person's sexual orientation. Respondents were asked "Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?" Response options included: "gay" or "lesbian", "straight, that is, not lesbian or gay", "bisexual", "something else", and "I don't know the answer". The wording of the question differed slightly for men and women, with men being asked if they are "gay" or "straight, that is, not gay" and women being asked if they are "lesbian or gay" or "straight, that is, not lesbian or gay". Persons who responded "something else" or "I don't know the answer" were asked follow-up questions about what they meant by "something else" or "don't know," but due to sample size constraints, those responses are not included in the publicly-available data.

According to the 2020 Survey Description, for some variables, including SEXORIEN, the 2020 responses of sample adults that were part of the 2020 longitudinal sample were overwritten with their 2019 responses "to mitigate disclosure risks associated with differences in response from repeated measures among the same Sample Adults" (33). The sample adults' actual 2020 responses can be accessed through a Research Data Center (RDC). For more information on the 2020 longitudinal sample, please see SALNGPRTFLG.

SEXORIEN was first introduced in 2013. Users interested in learning more about the cognitive testing involved in developing the NHIS sexual orientation questions can refer to the NHIS question evaluation report.]]></txt>

      <labl>Educational attainment</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults (and, prior to 2019, for all persons aged 5 and older), EDUC reports the highest level of schooling an individual had completed, in terms of completed grades for persons with less than a high school degree, and in terms of degrees attained for high school graduates and those with higher education.  Respondents were handed a card listing recognized categories and asked to identify the correct category.

According to the Field Representative's Manuals for 1997-2000, only "regular schooling which advances a person toward an elementary or high school diploma, or a college/university/professional school (such as law, medicine, dentistry)" counted as education.  Schooling in settings other than "regular schools" counted only if the credits obtained were acceptable in a regular school system.  Thus, for example, "adult education" classes not taken for credit or for the attainment of a college degree did not count.  

For the end of high school, EDUC distinguishes between those who completed twelfth grade but did not attain a diploma (e.g., those who failed to pass state-mandated high school exit examinations), those who graduated from high school, and those passed the GED (General Equivalence Degree) Test (which certifies that the test taker has attained high school-level academic skills).  Persons who attained a high school diploma in less than twelve years were to be recorded as "high school graduates," a guideline consistent with EDUC's emphasis on degrees attained rather than years spent in the classroom.  The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to probe to determine whether persons who attended "post-graduate" high school classes but did not attend college had received a high school diploma.  

For nurses, interviewers were to determine whether training was received in a college or in a nursing school (with the grade completed at the last regular--non-nursing--school to be entered in the latter case).  For a person attending special education classes or a school for persons with mental, physical, or developmental difficulties, interviewers were to ask which grade in a regular school most closely matched the individual's education level.  Persons currently in school were generally assumed to have completed the previous grade.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults aged 18+ (and all persons age 18+ in 2004-2018) who worked at a paid or unpaid job or business last week, held a seasonal or contract position last week, or were not working last week because they were on vacation, on family/maternity leave, unable to work for health reasons, HOURSWRK reports the total hours that the sample person worked in the past week. or in the past two weeks at all jobs/ businesses or at the main job/business. The universe and time period for HOURSWRK were somewhat different for 1979 and 1991. HOURSWORK reports total hours worked in the past two weeks for sample persons aged 17+ in 1979 who, during the past 2 weeks, worked, had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent, or looked for work or were on layoff; in 1991, HOURSWORK reports total work hours worked in the  past two weeks for sample persons aged 18+ in 1991 who were employed in the past 2 weeks and worked for a private company or the federal, state, or local government. Please refer to the Universe and Comparability tabs for more information about changes in the universe, time period, and the types of jobs included in HOURSWRK.

Beginning in 2019, sample adults aged 18+ who held a seasonal or contract position last week continued to be identified by NCHS as included in the universe for HOURSWORK, but were omitted from the HOURSWRK question and had their responses set to "Unknown - Not Ascertained."]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults and sample children, INCFAM07ON provides total grouped family income using an income bracket methodology introduced in 2007. Responses are reported in nominal dollars and have not been adjusted for inflation. Prior to 2019, INCFAM07ON was asked of all persons.
&nbsp;Starting with the 2007 NHIS, the income amount follow-up questions that had been in place since 1997 were replaced with a series of unfolding bracket questions. The unfolding bracket method asked a series of closed-ended income range questions (e.g., "Is it less than $50,000?") if the respondent did not provide an answer to the exact income amount question. The closed-ended income range questions were constructed so that each successive question establishes a smaller range for the amount of the family's income.]]></txt>

      <labl>Duration of moderate activity 10+ minutes: Minutes</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults who do moderate physical activities (MOD10FTP), MOD10DMIN is a recoded variable created by the staff at the National Center for Health Statistics that draws upon the information in MOD10DNO (Duration of moderate activity 10+ minutes: Number of units) and MOD10DTP (Duration of moderate activity 10+ minutes: Time period) and reports the duration of light or moderate leisure-time physical activities in terms of a standardized time unit, minutes.  Thus, a respondent who engaged in moderate exercise for an hour and half would have a MOD10DMIN value of 90 (to represent 90 minutes).

Light or moderate leisure-time activities are described in the survey questionnaire as activities that "cause only light sweating or a slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate."  The Field Representative's Manual provides examples of light or moderate activities, although these examples were not routinely shared with respondents.  These examples include leisurely walking or bicycling, slow swimming or dancing, and simple gardening.

Beginning in 2020, individuals with a duration value (ascertained through combining MOD10DNO and MOD10DTP) equivalent to 720 minutes or 12 hours or more were coded as "996 - Extreme value." Additionally, the 2020 Survey Description notes that "an instrument error in 2020 allowed for entries of more than 24 hours in duration" (85). These entries were recoded to "Extreme value."

For general discussion of how and why the NHIS collected information on adult physical activity for 1997 forward, see VIG10FNO.]]></txt>

Prior to 2020, the survey text for MOD10FNO and MOD10FTP inquired specifically about exercise that lasted at least 10 minutes. Beginning in 2020, the question did not include this provision.

Light or moderate activities are described in the survey question itself as activities that "cause only light sweating or a slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate."  The Field Representative's Manualprovides examples of light or moderate leisure-time physical activities, although these examples were not routinely shared with respondents.  These examples include leisurely walking or bicycling, slow swimming or dancing, and simple gardening.

According to the Field Representative's Manuals for 2001-2018, the maximum frequency of each broad category of physical activity (moderate activity, vigorous activity, strengthening activities, and stretching activities) was topcoded at 4 times per day (or its equivalent in some other time unit). Beginning in 2020, individuals with values of 4 times per day (or its equivalent) or greater were coded as "93 - Extreme value."

      <txt><![CDATA[EMOSUPPORT reports responses by sample adults to the question, "How often do you get the social and emotional support you need?  Would you say always, usually, sometimes, rarely, or never?" In 2020, EMOSUPPORT is only asked of sample adults in quarters 3 and 4.

2001 Related Variables&nbsp;The question for EMOSUPPORT is one of a series included in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) as part of the Healthy People 2010 initiative.  One goal of this initiative is to "promote the health of people with disabilities, prevent secondary conditions, and eliminate disparities between people with and without disabilities in the U.S. population."  More specifically, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Healthy People 2010, V. II, Objectives for Improving Health, articulated the following goal: "Increase the proportion of adults with disabilities reporting sufficient emotional support" (i.e., to achieve parity with adults without disabilities).   In this context, a response of "always" or "usually" in EMOSUPPORT was considered evidence of "sufficient social support."  (See U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Tracking Healthy People 2010. Part B: Operational Definitions #6.)

Other variables used to track different aspects of social support for the Healthy People 2010 initiative and included in the 2001 NHIS are:

How satisfied with life (SATISFIED)

How often felt happy, past 30 days (HAPPY30)

Got together socially with friends or neighbors, past 2 weeks (SAWFRIEND

Talked with friends or neighbors on the telephone, past 2 weeks (CALLFRIEND)

Got together with any relatives with whom they did not live, past 2 weeks (SAWRELS)

Talked on the telephone with any relatives with whom they did not live, past 2 weeks (CALLRELS)

Went to church, temple, or another place of worship for services or other activities, past 2 weeks (WORSHIP)

Went to a show, movie, sports event, club meeting, class or other group event, past 2 weeks (GROUPEVENT)

Went out to eat at a restaurant, past 2 weeks (ATEOUT)
2020 Related Variables&nbsp;NCHS added nearly 30 questions related to COVID starting in quarter 3 of the 2020 NHIS questionnaire, eight of which are asked of both sample adults and sample children. In addition to EMOSUPPORT, CMPSUPPORT is also asked to ascertain how much social and emotional support the person received in comparison to 12 months prior (pre-pandemic).
